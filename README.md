# Steps to Deploy a Docker Container to Azure
# Step 1: Create a Docker Container Locally
1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Create a simple app (for example, Python Flask or Node.js).
3. Create a Dockerfile:    

### Example for Python Flask app
    FROM python:3.11-slim
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    COPY . .
    EXPOSE 5000
    CMD ["python", "app.py"]`

## Step 1: Create a Docker Image

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root.

### Example Dockerfile
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
